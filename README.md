Personal Enterprise Achievements

# About

A way to define and encourage personal achievements in an enterprise environment through the usage of gamification.
Using points (or peas), badges and levels anyone can easily track the learning knowledge of any person in a company,
encouraging the competition to achieve as many badges as possible and motivate the whole team to start learning and
making progress.

# Demo

You can register yourself in the application and start using it.

## Sample Activities

We provide some sample activities that can be used to see how it works:
- First Badge: Access http://serverURL/triggers/sample/first and get the first badge.
- Second Badge: Access http://serverURL/triggers/sample/second and get the second badge.
- Spammer: Access http://serverURL/triggers/sample/first 5 times and get the spammer badge (together with 70 PEAs).

## GitHub Integration

Also, we provided a way to get Activities from GitHub commits. What you have to do to achieve this? 
Just add http://serverURL/triggers/helloWorld/github in your desired application and we will add some badges.
